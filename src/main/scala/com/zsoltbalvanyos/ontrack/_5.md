#### Explain what the following code means:
```
  trait MyAlg[F[_]] {
    def insertItSomewhere(someInt: Int): F[Unit]
    def doSomething(someInt: Int): F[Int]
  }
```
`Mention some advantages of the above code.`

It means that every object that implements the MyAlg trait has to implement the `insertItSomewhere` and `doSomething` functions.
The advantage of this trait is that the effect type is parameterized, this way the implementing class can decide which effect monad it wants to use.
